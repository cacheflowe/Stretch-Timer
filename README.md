# Stretch Timer

A little desktop app that reminds you to get up and stretch. Your desk job is slowly killing you. 

To initialize a new Neutralino app:

```bat
npm install -g @neutralinojs/neu
neu create stretch-timer
```

To run:

```bat
neu run
```

To build /dist files:

```bat
neu build
neu build --release
```

If ./bin doesn't exist, create a new app and copy the contents:

```bat
neu create stretch-timer
```


### Todo:

* Rebuild with Neutralino.js
* Add new images and videos
* Replace completely unauthorized, stolen stretch images
