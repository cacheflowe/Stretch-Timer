Stretch Timer
---
A little Mac OS X app that reminds you to get up and stretch. Your desk job is slowly killing you. 

This was a little experiment to get familiar with the Titanium Desktop SDK.

Todo:
---
* replace completely unauthorized, stolen stretch images
* clean up menu creation method
* add an additional break timer, for Pomodoro timing ability
